"""Multi-credential rotation engine shared by rotating provider wrappers.

Health model (aligned with the multi-provider proxy's key pool):
  - HEALTHY: serving requests.
  - COOLDOWN: briefly benched after an error (tiered 10s -> 30s -> 60s -> 120s).
  - CIRCUIT_OPEN: 3+ consecutive failures; benched until cooldown elapses.
  - HALF_OPEN: recovering; a single probe request is allowed through.
  - LOCKED_OUT: auth failure (401/403); escalating lockout 5min -> 1h -> 24h,
    then a half-open probe before full reuse.

Policies:
  - ``single``: always the first key.
  - ``round_robin``: spread requests across healthy keys in turn.
  - ``least_used``: healthy key with the fewest requests goes first.
  - ``failover`` (alias ``on_error``): stick to the first healthy key until it
    fails, then move to the next.
